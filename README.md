# Projectr

Finds a semi-randomish GitHub repo for a selected language and retrieves an open issue from it.  For when you want to contribute to open source, but have no idea what to work on.

## Development

Gems are managed with Bundler and we use Haml, CoffeeScript, and Sass.

The application can be launched by running:

    rake hopla
